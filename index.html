                <h3>Blood Moon and Brighter Mars – How to watch both?</h3>
                <p>Friday night will give stargazers a visual feast as two spectacular celestial events coincident on 
                    the same day. Viewers, from sunset today to the early hours of tomorrow, will be able to watch two 
                    “red balls” in the sky, weather permitting</p>

                <h3>Longest total lunar eclipse of the 21st century</h3>

                    eclipse in January, another significant lunar eclipse of the 
                    year is about to reveal itself. The total lunar eclipse on Friday will be the longest of the century, 
                    which will last for 1 hour and 43 minutes. The next lunar eclipse of such a length is due in 2123.
                </p>
                <p>The moon will appear red in color during the total eclipse instead of turn completely dark because the atmosphere will filter out most 
                    of the sun’s blue light, and make the moon look red, said NASA.
                </p>
                <p>The first on-record occurred in China about 3,000 years ago. Stated in <mark class="highlight">Yi Zhou Shu</mark><a class="icon-big-screen" data-toggle="popover" data-original-title="" title=""><img class="blue-moon" id="yi-zhou" src="./images/tylde.png" /></a>

                    , a compendium of Chinese historical documents 
                    about the Western Zhou period, the eclipse happened on January 29, 1137 BC. In history, the “Blood Moon” has often been 
                    considered around the world as a sign of <mark class="highlight">infelicity</mark><a class="icon-big-screen" data-toggle="popover" data-original-title="" title=""><img class="blue-moon" id="infel" src="./images/tylde.png" /></a>

                    Blood Moon represents war and death, meaning that a coup will happen, and soldiers and ministers will die during the fight

                <h3>How to observe the total lunar eclipse?</h3>
                <p>Unlike solar eclipses, the total lunar eclipse can be observed with the naked eye.
                    The upcoming lunar event will be visible from Europe, Africa and the Middle East between sunset and midnight on July 27 and then between midnight and 
                    sunrise on July 28 in much of Asia and Australia. If you live in Africa, the Middle East or countries in central Asia, 
                    you got lucky, because you can observe the entire eclipse.
                </p>
                <p>The time of the eclipse will be at 4:21 p.m. EDT (2021 GMT) on Friday, and the total eclipse will last from 3:30 p.m. to 5:13 p.m. <mark class="highlight">EDT</mark> <a class="icon-big-screen" data-toggle="popover" data-original-title="" title=""><img class="blue-moon"  id="era-time" src="./images/tylde.png" /></a>
                    <a class="icon-small-screen" ><img class="blue-moon" id="popover-edt"  src="./images/tylde.png" /></a>(1930 to 2113 GMT), 
                    according to EarthSky.org.

                <h3>Beautiful, brighter orb in the sky</h3>
                <p>You may have heard the news that <mark class="highlight">a liquid water lake was discovered on Mars</mark><a class="icon-big-screen" data-toggle="popover" data-original-title="" title=""><img class="blue-moon" id="lake"  src="./images/tylde.png" /></a>

                    , but have you ever seen the planet? Take a look tonight! The celestial spectacle of Mars shows 
                    up in the night sky earlier than the total lunar eclipse tonight. Its called “Mars opposition” when the Sun, Earth and Mars are in a line with the Sun and Mars on directly 
                    opposite sides of the Earth
                </p>
                <p>The Mars opposition occurs about every 26 months, but a perihelic opposition – when Mars opposition happens at its closest position to the Sun – happens in every 15 to 17 
                    years due to factors like their elliptical orbit>s and Mars double orbit time around the Sun compared to Earth, according to NASA.
                </p>
                <p>“The orange-red Mars will be like a shining star hung in the sky at that time,”said Hu Fanghao from Purple Mountain Observatory of Chinese Academy of Science. 
                    “It’s a rare chance to see the ‘red star’ shining throughout the night. It’s well worth watching.”
